    <p><a href="http://soundry.co">Soundry Co</a>. make bespoke audio software. To set the company
    apart from competitors and to reflect their focus on whole-product design and user experience,
    I created a bright and bold visual identity underpinned by Suitcase Type Foundry's <a
    href="https://www.suitcasetype.com/nudista/specimen">Nudista</a> &mdash; the perfect match for a
    modern engineering outfit.</p>

    <p>An array of brand artwork pieces gives context to the simple mono combination mark, and
    luxury die-cut letterpress business cards show that quality is the company’s primary focus.</p>

- title: "Earsoft Audio"
  subtitle: "App Design &amp; Coding"
  description: >

    <p>I designed and built a unique audio player app for Earsoft that tailors sound to the
    listener’s environment and mood. The visuals are based around clean typography and strong
    iconography, and the two-tone colour scheme is algorithmically generated based on a hue chosen
    by the user.</p>

    <p>The implementation had to be very low level to ensure good battery life while listening, so
    I wrote a C library to do the audio processing, and connected it using iOS’s AudioUnit API and
    Android’s NDK for playback.</p>

- title: "Cantare Ladies’ Choir"
  subtitle: "Logo &amp; Colour Guide"
  description: >

    <p>Cantare needed a strong, bold logo to use on everything from posters and concert programmes
    to bags and embroidered coats. They already had a strong black and pink colour scheme, so I
    worked with the group on a combination mark that would tie their brand together.</p>

    <p>After several prototypes and lots of feedback, we settled on a treble clef mark shaped to
    depict a young woman. <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/schmalhans">FF Schmalhans</a> was
    a natural fit for the lettering &mdash; the tall, angled characters are intended to mimic the
    proud, singing women.</p>

  subtitle: "Wedding Stationery Pack"
  description: >

    <p>The couple wanted a modern, elegant stationery pack, with a few extras such as a map for the
    day and a list of local attractions for guests to browse.</p>

    <p>I decided on mostly black and white detail with some dark red to highlight key items. To
    fulfil the stylistic brief I chose <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)">Futura</a> for labels and <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minion_(typeface)">Minion</a> for prose, matching each
    face's character by drawing diagrams with bold lines and dividing text with thin ones.</p>
