The couple wanted a modern, elegant stationery pack, with a few extras such as a map for the day and a list of local attractions for guests to browse.

I decided on mostly black and white detail with some dark red to highlight key items. To fulfil the stylistic brief I chose [Futura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) for labels and [Minion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minion_(typeface)) for prose, matching each faceâ€™s character by drawing diagrams with bold lines and dividing text with thin ones.
