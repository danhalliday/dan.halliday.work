  I’m a technologist and designer with over fifteen years’ experience. As founder of several active technology companies and technical director and consultant to many more, I like to keep my projects varied. From visual design and user experience all the way through full stack web development to apps and low level programming — if it’s interesting, I’m interested.

  If you’re working on something good, I want to be the first to hear about it! Email me and [introduce yourself](mailto:hi@danhalliday.com).
