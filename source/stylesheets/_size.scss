// Why create a responsive mixin which just takes numbers and wraps a media query?
//
// Numbers are good to see at the call site. Things get abstract fast when using 'small', 'medium',
// 'large', 'x-large' etc. Which size applies to iPad Pro in portrait, again? But theyâ€™re also
// typo-prone, so the mixin fixes that with some compile-time safety.

$d-sizes: 350 600 900 1200 1500 1800;

@mixin d-size($size) {
  @if (index($d-sizes, $size) == null) {
    @error "#{$size}px is not a specified breakpoint size";
  }

  @media screen and (min-width: #{$size}px) {
    @content;
  }
}
