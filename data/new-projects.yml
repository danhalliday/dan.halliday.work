    <p>While studying for my Tonmeister degree at <a href="http://www.surrey.ac.uk">Surrey
    University</a>, I wrote a research paper on localised sound diffusion techniques. The paper
    needed original and reproduced diagrams and charts, as well as equation setting.</p>

    <p>I chose the always-stellar <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minion_(typeface)">Minion</a> for text, and paired it with
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima">Optima</a> for captions and labels, drawing the
    diagrams in a straightforward, un-ornamented style.</p>
