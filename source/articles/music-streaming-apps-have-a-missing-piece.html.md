<span class="d-article-lede">In the days before the internet was fast</span>, I was a music fan with a plan. As a teenager, I had a collection of perhaps a hundred compact discs, and assumed it would soon be two or three hundred. Buying music after school on the advice of peers who seemed to know what was hot, I usually listened to each album a couple of times straight through on my stereo before moving to the computer and beginning the *lossless ripping ceremony*.

The idea of creating and curating a music collection made sense. The goal was to grow and prune it like a garden, all the while enjoying raw sound, learning about the world, swapping albums with friends, and being inspired to create art of my own. And like any good hobby, it had a certain cadence, fixed by the cost of acquisition and the time available to hear about new stuff.

The combination of a shelf full of discs and an iTunes library was a good one. The shelf provided the rich artwork and at-a-glance browsing of a traditional record collection — albeit at a much smaller size and diminished by compact discs’ hideous jewel case design. The computer library enabled instant search, playlists, endless remixing, and then iPod playback too.

In the early noughties, software didn’t change and break all that rapidly, and time spent using something like iTunes to do something like adding five-star ratings to all your songs and creating smart playlists mixing rating, genre, and release date seemed like time well spent. Despite personal computers’ slowness and expensive storage, the endeavor was worthwhile. The digital part of music collecting was just a neat extension of the physical part.

# Surprise

But some way into the streaming revolution, I stopped buying discs. It seemed like a waste of money. The move to subscription services was a real shock to the system, and for a long time it killed my enthusiasm for finding and listening to new music. For me, the abundance of a streaming library was like reaching middle age and starting to buy all the gadgets you could never afford when you were younger, having little or no time to actually use them. And worse, realising that much of the enjoyment had really been in the anticipation — in thumbing through catalogues, in pouring over technical specs, and in rumours about next year’s models.

I’ve mostly gotten used to it. Over the past decade as mobile and home internet have improved, streaming music services have come a long way. I certainly love some of the features the modern apps make possible. I put networked speakers around the house, painstakingly hard-wired through plaster and joist for minimum latency and robust sync, that supply a lush soundtrack to any activity. And few years in, I’m listening to more new music, which — *assuming I can find it again later* — is a good thing. But the experience is still missing a piece.

# Tools of Engagement

No shortage of opinion exists on what was lost during the previous major format transition from records to discs. Audio quality improved at the cost of that of artwork. Shuffle arrived at the expense of an artist’s vision for their complete album. Longevity increased one hundredfold, and each listen become less valuable. The common thread is that the *process of engagement* with the art changed. A process previously bounded — to its benefit — by the physical limits of acquisition and playback.

Our present transition takes things to their logical end point. The art is completely accessible, the methods of discovery and engagement completely digital. In fact, discovery isn’t half bad, with all the major players offering a broad weekly lineup of preset and algorithmically generated content. A little sterile, perhaps, compared to huddling with friends round the *new music* section of a decent record store, desperately scanning for the latest Dream Theater, but novel and usable. Engagement, though, is still shallow at best.

Likes, ratings, playlists, and sharing are all fine features, but they do not compare to *the shelf*. As the humble user of someone else’s service, you’re not in control of when these features appear and disappear, nor how they’re presented from one software release to the next. My current app of choice, Apple’s *Music*, has played around with ratings a few times, eventually moving traditional five-star rating controls out to secondary screens and bringing in a new ‘love’ and ‘dislike’ button. Another casualty is the checkbox then-iTunes used to show for every track, denoting whether a song would be skipped during normal playback. I used to use this feature *all the time* to customise my album playback experience, cutting out an intro skit here, or a filler track or artist interview there. It’s also still available in a submenu (bafflingly titled ‘untick selection’), but for how long? It’s hard to say.

I don’t blame anybody. Software moves with the times, and I do my share of the moving. But I’ve developed a keen aversion to investing time tending metadata in library systems like this. It’s a lesson in software rot that I learned most painfully in the case of photos, wherein my current library has been migrated through at least three different apps, and now contains fifteen years of only mostly-not-corrupted images with barely any remaining historic album, rating, or editing metadata. And besides all that, the competitive market means each month also brings some chance that a competing service’s offer will be worth ditching your investment anyway.

Granted, some of this stuff borders on niche interest — I do realise that not everybody cares whether their likes and ratings persist beyond next month, let alone next year. But the heart wants what the heart wants. And sometimes the heart wants unfettered access to a decade of well-maintained music metadata to check the play count on some Steely Dan tracks. For a more general idea of how much the average listener uses likes and other engagement features, consider the multiple failures of Apple’s social music effort: both *Ping* and *Connect* petered out to nothing barely weeks after launch.

My issues with playlists as a feature tend more towards indifference. While they’re barely changed from what existed in early versions of iTunes, nowadays I find myself mainly playing tracks from the ‘recently added’ section over and over, or searching directly for classic albums — rarely do I browse my old playlists or make any new ones. I suppose that before, I wasn’t so worried about the software changing under my feet, or about eventually losing things after a library migration or two. And I also often burned playlists to disc, scribbled on them, and carried them around in a wallet. Which was, well, way more fun!

But why was it more fun? Herein lies our missing piece. Take a moment to recall and admire the artefacts of the old world of physical media: a colourful wall of records; a cheeky birthday mixtape; a footwell lined with old road trip discs. They’re all things that listeners made. The current crop of music apps are slick and laden with features, *but you don’t get to create anything*.

One reason for this is that these platforms are just so big, and have to appeal to many different use cases. All the features tend to converge on the lowest-common-denominator *passive consumption* use case, and little space is left for anything too interesting or which requires enough effort to scare off the casual listener. I don’t mean to pooh-pooh this core experience. It’s amazing that anyone with access to a device and monthly cash on the same order as a mobile phone contract now has easy access to the entire history of recorded music, and scores of product designers and developers toil to make it happen. My observation is simply that the core experience is about it.

Taking another look back on my old collecting and curation habits through the lens of modern user-centred design, I suppose being an avid collector of disks and a burgeoning metadata junkie put me well outside the handful of common, more passive, use cases right from the start. Then, the product (discs and tapes), and tools (playback hardware and music software) were much more loosely coupled and open for access, so you had lots of ways to play around with the pieces — from the enterprising teen recording songs from the radio onto cassettes and adding their own voiceover to create a toy radio show, to the avid record enthusiast, transforming their spare room into a colourful music den. Now, everything is so tightly integrated and centralised that it’s far harder to diverge from the core use case, or use the supplied media in a novel way. What can we do to bring a bit more creativity and joy to the digital music experience?

# Creativity & Joy

You can certainly continue, or get back to, collecting physical media alongside listening online, as many have during the much-reported vinyl revival of the past few years. That’s an interesting space, especially on the business end, with some artists now charging a premium for physical products that might actually come somewhere close to paying for their labour. It’s not for me, though. I want to see the next stage in digital.

I think the way forward is for independent developers and small teams to build simple, focused apps that sit on top of the major streaming services, treating the platforms as infrastructure, which is now possible since they all provide decent [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API). It’s not a new idea by any means, but it always surprises me how few novel music player apps show up when you search the app stores. Most of the results are just clones of the system music players and don’t bring anything new to the table. While it is notable how many really high quality music production apps exist, especially on mobile, that’s obviously a more specialist area. DJ apps that pull music from streaming services are a great example of the general approach, and while still fairly specialised, they provide exactly the kind of creative layer I want to experiment with.

With a diverse enough community of accessible third-party music experience apps, and by putting some real thought into how apps’ content might interact and combine to form new experiences, I think we can place the missing piece. It might have taken a few years, but I think I've finally got my head around the streaming music experience, started really enjoying it, and figured out what more I want from it. Time to build something!<span class="d-article-end-mark"></span>
