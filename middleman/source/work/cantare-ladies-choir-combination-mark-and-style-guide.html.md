Cantare needed a strong, bold logo to use on everything from posters and concert programmes to bags and embroidered coats. They already had a strong black and pink colour scheme, so I worked with the group on a combination mark that would tie their brand together.

After several prototypes and lots of feedback, we settled on a treble clef mark shaped to depict a young woman. [FF Schmalhans](https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/schmalhans) was a natural fit for the lettering &mdash; the tall, angled characters are intended to mimic the proud, singing women.
