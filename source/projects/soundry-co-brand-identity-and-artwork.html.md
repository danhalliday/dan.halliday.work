[Soundry Co](http://soundry.co) make bespoke audio software. To set the company apart from their competition and to reflect its focus on whole-product design and user experience, I worked with [Web Workshop](https://webworkshop.ltd) to create a bright and bold visual identity underpinned by Suitcase Type Foundry’s [Nudista](https://www.suitcasetype.com/nudista/specimen) — the perfect match for a modern engineering outfit.

An array of brand artwork pieces gives context to the simple mono combination mark, and luxury die-cut letterpress business cards show that quality is the company’s primary focus.
