    [Soundry Co](http://soundry.co). make bespoke audio software. To set the company apart from competitors and to reflect its focus on whole-product design and user experience, I created a bright and bold visual identity underpinned by Suitcase Type Foundry’s [Nudista](https://www.suitcasetype.com/nudista/specimen) &mdash; the perfect match for a modern engineering outfit.

    An array of brand artwork pieces gives context to the simple mono combination mark, and luxury die-cut letterpress business cards show that quality is the company’s primary focus.

    I designed and built a unique audio player app for Earsoft that tailors sound to the listener’s environment and mood. The visuals are based around clean typography and strong iconography, and the two-tone colour scheme is algorithmically generated based on a hue chosen by the user.

    The implementation had to be very low level to ensure good battery life while listening, so I wrote a C library to do the audio processing, and connected it using iOS’s AudioUnit API and Android’s NDK for playback.

    Cantare needed a strong, bold logo to use on everything from posters and concert programmes to bags and embroidered coats. They already had a strong black and pink colour scheme, so I worked with the group on a combination mark that would tie their brand together.

    After several prototypes and lots of feedback, we settled on a treble clef mark shaped to depict a young woman. [FF Schmalhans](https://www.fontfont.com/fonts/schmalhans) was a natural fit for the lettering &mdash; the tall, angled characters are intended to mimic the proud, singing women.

    The couple wanted a modern, elegant stationery pack, with a few extras such as a map for the day and a list of local attractions for guests to browse.

    I decided on mostly black and white detail with some dark red to highlight key items. To fulfil the stylistic brief I chose [Futura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)) for labels and [Minion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minion_(typeface)) for prose, matching each face’s character by drawing diagrams with bold lines and dividing text with thin ones.
