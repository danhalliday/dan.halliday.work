          About Me
        </h2>

        <p>
          I’m a technologist and designer with over fifteen years’ experience. As founder of several active technology companies and technical director and consultant to many more, I like to keep my projects varied. From visual design and user experience all the way through full stack web development to apps and low level programming — if it’s interesting, I’m interested.
