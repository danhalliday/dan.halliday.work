  I’m an independent technologist and designer based in and around London.

  Over fifteen years, I’ve founded several active technology companies, and worked as technical director and consultant to many more. From visual design and user experience all the way through full stack web development to apps and low level programming — if it’s interesting, I’m interested.

  Working on something really good? Email and [introduce yourself](mailto:dan@halliday.work).
